1. what is SOLID principle?
-> These principle
Single responsilbility - A class should have only one responsibility and should have less reasons to change.
			Low responsibility will have lower test cases and lower dependencies.
Open for extension, closed for modification - Classes should be open for extension and closed for modification,
						to stop ourself from creating potential new bugs.
liskov substitution - As per this, a class should be replacable with another class without 
			disrupting the behaviour of replaced class.
Interface segregation -  As per this, larger interfaces should be split into smaller ones. By doing so, we can ensure 
			that implementing classes only need to be concerned about the methods that are of interest to them.
Dependency Inversion - As per this, High level module should not depend on low level module, they should depend on Abstraction.
